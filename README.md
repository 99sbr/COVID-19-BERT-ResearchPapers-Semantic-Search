if you are able to endorse me on Arxiv, i would be more than glad https://arxiv.org/auth/endorse?x=FRBB89 thanks 


BERT semantic search engine for searching literature research papers for coronavirus covid-19 in google colab

## Data links
- [proccessed dataset](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17CmqI2uyYitpos6Lxmk4E7PSShIMmxUm)
- [embedded paragraphs (1GB)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-PYF5y1hIpzwoXosNIpBP2L_Gyt5oUbv) which took some time for embedding, 
  so you can simply use it without running the embedding again
  
which are hosted on google drive, we have built the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/theamrzaki/covid-19-bert-researchpapers-semantic-search), 
to seamlessly connect to google drive, (learn more about connecting with google drive here)
